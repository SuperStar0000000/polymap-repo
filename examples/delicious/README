This is an advanced example showing live timeclouds based on a users delicious
tags.

The example must be run on a PHP aware webserver, which processes the data live
and feeds it to the timecloud.

You need to have a valid account on delicious for this to try out.

If you have all this on your php-aware webserver you can point your browser to
delicious.html and enjoy your life in delicious tags. :)
