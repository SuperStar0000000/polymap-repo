This is an advanced example showing live timeclouds based on a users delicious
tags.

The example must be run on a PHP aware webserver, which processes the data live
and feeds it to the timecloud.

You need to have a valid account on delicious for this to try out, in the
delicious.php file you need to set your delicious username and password,
otherwise it will not work.

To make the tags in the timecloud link to your related bookmarks on delicious,
you should set the username value also in the delicious.html file.

If you have all this on your php-aware webserver you can point your browser to
delicious.html and enjoy your life in delicious tags. :)
